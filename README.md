# git_github-fundamentals-Niklaas22
My name is Jan-Niklaas Vogel, I go by Nik. I'm an international student from serbia. I speak 5 lnaguages; one of my favorite hobbies is to play soccer and enjoy watching sports, especially american football. I would like to learn real world applications that will help guide me towards my future job, and not just unneccessary theoretical lessons. Curerently I'm working on this specific file, and soon I will be happy to be done with it.
