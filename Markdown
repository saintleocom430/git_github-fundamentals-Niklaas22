What have I learned? - So far I have learned nothing fun, this Github thing seems a bit complicated; especially to those who have never even heard about it. I hope that at some point that our professor decides to teach us something worthwhile abou how to use Github efficiently. I am confused on why we have to use Github and the improtance to it for for this particular class.
